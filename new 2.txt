own couple thousand acres out west
	manage for ag and water potential
	more focused on legal and effeciency of use rather than climate side of water rights
initially reticent about potential utility of CAi to their business
rolled eyes heavily at 'we want to pick your brains'
	'we are not in the brains picking business'
specific to US (and Aus)
	legal status to the rights that we own (i.e., high seniority)
	has the water been used historically (affects rights)
	are there ways to enhance water effeciency
		fallow or change crops
	is there a market for our excess water
		interested in offering our water to potential buyers
	is the community in which we operate supportive of those actions
'climate is impacting the macro, but we are not focused on climate variability' directly
most of their time is building relationships (esp. with farmers)
how to you assess improvements in effeciency of water use	
	assess historical practices
	typically dealing with annual crops
		easy to turn on and off
	act more as landlords than as farmers
		use leases to change 
	important: difficult to prove how water use effeciency has been increased
		prove to gov't agency
	usually sell water to municipalities, govts, and occassionally to environmental groups
	water is metered
		nonetheless, fed gov't will request whole plots are herbicided for validation
on-site storage
	there is additionally strong interest in impounding water on site in reservoirs or moreso recharging aquifers
not focused on the 6-month horizon
	we are selling 100-yr lease on water
	but there are other folks who may been
		esp. in Australia, with junior water players who speculate based on seasonal hydrologic cycle
		market is not as effecient in US to do so
	it might be useful on the water storage side 
	generally thinking on the 20-30yr time horizon
might be a great business in buying spill water from flood retention dams in cali
use hydrogeologists to map gw for long term assurity around rights
	quantify water volume
	what is recharge rate
	what depth could we take down water level without impacting 
	least favorite way of doing business, 
	could we refill, and use as an underground reservoir?
	and if refilled, would 
	basins and aquifers not spatially conforming
who would the seasonal projections be usefule for 
	municipalities, veles water index (partnered with nasdaq) [the NQH2O?]
discusses the NQH2O favoribly
	wishes that it were more liquid, but the illiquidity makes it not worth their while
	
wishes that there were more flexibility in the US market, as there is in the Aus market

surface water 80%, groundwater 20% (and surface water is the preferred)
trends that matter:
	heat (for ET)
	invest in companies that run hydroelectricity
	forest fire

fire prevention system that is mobile
	can be put around fire prone places with high value
		hotels, vineyards
a correlary:
	we sell water supply insurance, and everyone will need to build a water supply portfolio
	identifying locations that are likely in need supplemental water in the near future
there are not that many players in this field
